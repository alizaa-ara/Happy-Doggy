        <p>
          Happy Doggy was created by 4 dog-lovers. We want to create a community
          for dog owners who are time-poor, and connect them with dog-lovers who
          want the opportunity to connect to a dog and take them for walks! Dog
          walkers can see a list of dogs, choose one they would love to spend
          time with, and submit a request to walk, to the dog-owner. The owner
          can then decide if it`s a compatiple match, and say yes!

          We know that being short on time makes it harder to take your four

          dog-lover, who benefits from the walks as much as your pet!{' '}

          We know how much dogs love and need excercise and walks. Happy Doggy
          means your dogs make new friends with their walker, and get the walks
          they want! We love dogs, and want them to be as happy as they deserve
          to be. Happy Doggy makes that happen!
